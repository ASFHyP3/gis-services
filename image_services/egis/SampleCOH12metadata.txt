Global Seasonal Sentinel-1 Interferometric Coherence and Backscatter: 12-day median coherence for Dec/Jan/Feb in VV polarization. Pixel values in source rasters are the coherence value (ranging from 0 to 1) multiplied by 100. A processing template is applied to display the standard coherence values (0 to 1) in the service.
