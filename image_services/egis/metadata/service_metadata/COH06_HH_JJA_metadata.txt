Summary:
Global Summer (June/July/August) median 6-day coherence (COH06) in HH polarization from the Global Seasonal Sentinel-1 Interferometric Coherence and Backscatter Data Set.

Description:
Global Seasonal Sentinel-1 Interferometric Coherence and Backscatter: 6-day median coherence for June/July/August in HH polarization. Pixel values in source rasters are the coherence value (ranging from 0 to 1) multiplied by 100. A processing template is included with the service to provide the standard coherence values (0 to 1) along with the original source raster values.
The source rasters referenced in this service are available on the Registry of Open Data on AWS: https://registry.opendata.aws/ebd-sentinel-1-global-coherence-backscatter/
