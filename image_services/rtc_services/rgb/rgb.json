Blue areas have low returns in VV and VH (smooth surfaces such as calm water, but also frozen/crusted soil or dry sand), green areas have high returns in VH (volume scatterers such as vegetation or some types of snow/ice), and red areas have relatively high VV returns and relatively low VH returns (such as urban or sparsely vegetated areas).",
