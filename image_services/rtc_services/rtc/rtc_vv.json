    "ItemInfo/Description": "Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) products in VV polarization generated from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, processed by ASF. Values for the VV polarization are commonly driven by surface roughness and/or soil moisture, with rougher surfaces and higher soil moisture returning higher backscatter values. Surface water appears very dark under calm conditions, as the signal bounces off the surface away from the sensor.",
