    "ItemInfo/Description": "Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) products in VH polarization generated from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, processed by ASF. Values for the VH (cross-polarized) polarization are generally driven by volume scattering, with more complex volume scatterers (such as dense vegetation) returning higher backscatter values. Surface water generally appears very dark, as it is predominantly a surface scatterer; most returns remain in the primary polarization.",
