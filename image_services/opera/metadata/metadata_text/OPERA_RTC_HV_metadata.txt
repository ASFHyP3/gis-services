Summary:
OPERA Level-2 Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) products in HV polarization generated from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, processed by OPERA (JPL)

Description:
OPERA Level-2 Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) SAR Backscatter products in VH polarization generated from Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR imagery, processed by the OPERA project at JPL. Values for the VH (cross-polarized) polarization are generally driven by volume scattering, with more complex volume scatterers (such as dense vegetation) returning higher backscatter values. Surface water generally appears very dark, as it is predominantly a surface scatterer; most returns remain in the primary polarization.

The OPERA project is managed by JPL with partners from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the University of Maryland College Park, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Southern Methodist University, and EarthScope. Refer to [OPERA’s website](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera) for more details.
