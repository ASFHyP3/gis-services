Summary:
OPERA Level-2 Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) products in VH polarization generated from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, processed by OPERA (JPL)

Description:
OPERA Level-2 Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) products in VH polarization generated from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, processed by OPERA (JPL). Values for the VH (cross-polarized) polarization are generally driven by volume scattering, with more complex volume scatterers (such as dense vegetation) returning higher backscatter values. Surface water generally appears very dark, as it is predominantly a surface scatterer; most returns remain in the primary polarization.
